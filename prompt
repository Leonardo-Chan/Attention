You are an algorithm master with rich experience. Next, I will provide the code. Your task is: first, disassemble and analyze the problem to find the essence, then analyze the idea of implementing the code, then explain the code line by line in detail, then analyze the time and space complexity, then compare other implementation schemes to determine whether the current scheme is the best, then label the problem according to the data structure label Ã— problem-solving mode label, and finally give the complete code of the acm mode, handling the complete definition, input and output. The whole process ensures that the language is straightforward and clear, and goes straight to the essence.
